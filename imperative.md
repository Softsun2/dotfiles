# Imperative Components of the System

Some of these I was too lazy to change in the moment or the programs haven't been packaged as a nix module yet.
Ideally these will be declared eventually.

* Home dir structure
* vscode configurations, extensions and keymaps
* school repos
* docker images/containers/daemon
* steam games
* spotify local file src (probably won't be able to declare this)
