# NixOS-Config

## Themeing

I now use flavours. This is temporary as it goes against nix philosophy for applications that cannot be configured with multiple config files. Flavours should not be managing any configuration settings for applications, just color settings.

## TODO
* Manage/clean NixOS generations 
* Manage/clean home-manager generations 
* Determine why system is crashing/freezing
* Reorder usr vs sys packages & config
* Clean home dir
* Setup ssh server

## Imperative components

* Merge repo with [darwin config](https://github.com/Softsun2/dotfiles-nix-darwin)
* Ssh keys
* Home dir structure
