# NixOS-Config
Still a nix novice. Slowly building my system.

## Goal
  To declare system and user configurations as minimally and consistently as possible. Building from this flake should result in a system identical to mine.

## TODO
* Reorder usr vs sys packages & config
* cleanup vscode settings OR switch to nvim
* Manage/clean NixOS generations 
* Bar is TERRIBLE (probably due to grep)
* Doc ./bin/audiocontrol
* Get overlay for working spotifyu version
* Fix absolute path to bin in .zshrc
* Fix apply alias (builds result in working dir and not in .dotfiles)
* themeing/dwm patching
* switch to a different terminal emulator (maybe)

## NOTES
* vscode is partially declared (user settings are imperative)
